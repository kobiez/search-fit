# Search-in-fit

## New, nice looking, and convenient search engine for [Freefit](https://freefit.co.il/) website.

### Technologies

To create this app I used **Node.js** for the server and **React.js** for the client.
For the desigen I used **Material UI** library.

### Installation

- To install the app `npm install`

### Start

- To start the up `npm start`

- The app will start at localhost:5000

### Usage 

On the screen you will see the search box, start typing and you will recieve suggestions to choose from,
then just press on the search botton, to get the results.
Each result will be represented inside a card, the main section at the top of each card is a link to the activity
in freefit website. At the bottom of each card you will see to links, the first one will navigate you to the 
activity home page if exist, the second one also navigate you to the activity page at freefit site.

Please note:

- You can search maximum of two parameters for each search, one activity and one place.
- If you try to give as parameters two places or two activities, you will get results only for the first one,
    whether you search for places or activities.

### Contributing

Any suggestions, ideas and pull requests about how to improve the app will be welcome.
